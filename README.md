# YelpUsabilityStudy

Usability study and prototyping for pretend new Yelp functionality. Project developed for computer science course.
Project done in collaboration between five students that all took part in designing, running experiments and analyzing 
the results.

This medium-fidelity prototype usability study focused on evaluating the effectiveness and learnability of a fictitious 
feature that would allow people to build an itinerary of places to visit with Yelp. This project was created for the 
Computer Science course, Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction Methods (CPSC 344) at the University of British Columbia.
The focus and goals of the study were defined by the group, as well as the experiment was run with two researchers at all 
time for each individual.

So, I ran some experiment sessions while I contributed to the low and medium fidelity prototypes developed. Then, in a group
we all analyzed the data gathered and recorded the demo video. Finally, I wrote the summary of data, findings, and analysis 
of the report. This project was done in collaboration with four other students, A.M, D.C, O.P and T.T.


The project was developed on the premise of prototyping a new feature in an existing interface and then running an usability
study on a medium-fidelity prototype.
